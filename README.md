# AKL-News
My biggest application to date, developed as part of a team of 6 students. This was the practical part of my Master's thesis. The project was done over the course of three months, organized as an agile team using SCRUM to work effectively.

The application consists mainly of a fully-fledged web app that uses a web crawler to scan RSS-feeds for custom keywords and displays mathcing articles on the page neatly. Development was done in Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL as the db.

Unfortunately, the client company Archerknight Limited required the project team to sign an NDA, so I am not allowed to publish the source code here, however just message me for more infos or source code access.
The application can be found at https://rak4.herokuapp.com , however it requires login. Message me for screenshots of the funcitonalities.


Abstract from the thesis:

The concept of AKL News is to be an interactive web-based platform that will show potential customers of Archer Knight an insight and real-time view of the oil and gas market in different regions by collating news articles from multiple sources and tagging them for filtering by the user. Eventually, Archer Knight envisions AKL News to aggregate data from different sources, mainly consisting of RSS-feeds and vessel tracking services. However, as a first step Archer Knight commissioned the project team to focus on building a crawler that searches news sources based on a list of tags with relevant keywords. The crawler should then scan certain RSS-feeds and their article contents and show relevant data in such a way as to be user friendly, especially in the case where the user has very little to no knowledge of IT. AKL News is aimed to eventually be monetized on a subscription base and through advertisements. AKL News was originally meant to be part of the RAK4 concept which was the idea of emcomising many types of useful data about oil and gas companies and their current projects. RAK4 therefore was envisioned to be a one-stop-shop for everything oil and gas related, showing relationships between the companies, projects, ships and rigs. AKL News is the first part of the RAK4 concept which deals with the crawler and providing articles about the aforementioned areas above.
